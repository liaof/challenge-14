## Summary

For this week's challenge, I created a full stack blog being served via Heroku. Because this challenge coincides with
a group project, the scope of said challenge is understandbly smaller; much of the work required has been done in the preceeding two 
weeks in the module homework. That said, a revamp of the entire backend and frontend was needed to bring the functionality inline with 
the challenge requirements. This is a simple but very important exercise because the usage of a template for 
multiple tasks is a great efficancy booster, reflected in the very concept of MVC structuring
